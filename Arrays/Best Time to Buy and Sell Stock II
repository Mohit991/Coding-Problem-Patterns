# We need to buy the stock and sell it for some profit. Then we will collect all the profit from all of these transactions.

# buy means at what price we bought and is initialised to first price(we buy at first day).
# Profit is initialised to 0.

# As we go though the prices, if current price is less than the bought price(buy), then we forget about our bough price and update it with the current price because it is smaller.
# If currentPrice is more than bought price then we can sell and make a profit. So, we increase the profit by profit += currentPrice - buy . We also update our buy to current price.
