#Solution: We will use backtracking. We will create a function and we pass the start value which is 1 and 
#one empty array, combination. If length of combination is equal to k, then we know that we have found the 
#solution, we add to result and return. We will apply loop from start to n+1, and inside that we call
#backtrack with i+1 as start and we add i to the combination. 

class Solution:
    def combine(self, n: int, k: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        result = []
        def backtrack(start, combination):
            if len(combination) == k:
                result.append(combination)
                return
            
            for i in range(start, n+1):
                backtrack(i+1, combination+[i])
        
        backtrack(1, [])
        return result
