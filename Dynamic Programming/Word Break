#Tabulation
# TC - len(s) ^ 3

#To use tabulation, create an array of length len(s) + 1, call it f, put f[0] = True and rest as False. 
# f[i] stands for whether subarray(0, i) can be segmented into words from the dictionary. 
# So f[0] means whether subarray(0, 0) (which is an empty string) can be segmented, 
# and of course the answer is yes.
#Use two loops i from 1 to last and j from 0 to i-1. Here if f[j] is true that means substring 0 to j is True
#then we will just check j to i substring. If it is there then put f[i] = True.
#at last return f[len[s]]
