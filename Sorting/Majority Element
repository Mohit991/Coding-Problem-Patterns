#As it is given than the element occures more than half times, we can use this info to construct a soution. 
#We take two vars, elementCount and majorityElement. elementCount = 1 and majorityElement = first element. 
#Take all elements from second onwards. If the current element is same as majorityElement then increment
#the elementCount. If not decrease the elementCount. If at any point element count hits 0 then you must change
#the majority element. Set majority element as the current element and elementCount = 1 and continue. 
#TC - O(n), SC - O(1)
