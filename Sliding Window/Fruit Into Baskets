# FYI: "secondFruit" is the rightmost fruit, "firstFruit" is the fruit on the left of the 
# consecutive "secondFruit" at the tail, countOfSecondFruit is the number of consecutive 
# "secondFruit" at the tail.

# let's visualize it:
# Given "aabbabbb", before we see the next fruit newFruit, currentCount = 8, countOfSecondFruit = 3 
# (length of "bbb")

# Case 1: newFruit == secondFruit. We have "aabbabbb(b)"
# "bbb" is extended by one, so countOfSecondFruit = 3+1, and currentCount = 8+1
# Case 2: newFruit == firstFruit. We have "aabbabbb(a)"
# update firstFruit and secondFruit, currentCount = 8+1, countOfSecondFruit = 1 (length of "a")
# Case 3: newFruit != firstFruit && newFruit != secondFruit. We have "aabbabbb(c)"
# update firstFruit and secondFruit, currentCount = countOfSecondFruit + 1 (length of bbbc), 
# countOfSecondFruit = 1 (length of "c")

# Another solution we can use is to use a map or dict. 
#We take two pointers left and right. We will start from 0 and move right. 
# We will put elements into the map and increment their freq. When we see more than 2 elements in
# map, that means we have move than 2 unique elements in our window, hence we will start from left
# and remove freq of element from left(window will shrink from left). If freq == 1 we will remove
# element from dict. Once we get length of dict again as 2 then we will continue to expand our 
# window to the right.
